        <p>JPMorgan Chase Bank is yanking away some consumer rights from credit card holders, but we can stop them.</p>

        <p>With their “forced arbitration” clause, they’re changing the agreement so that you can’t get class-action payouts or sue them in open court if they mistreat you as a customer. For details on why this is bad, see the coverage on Boing Boing and Fast Company. </p>
