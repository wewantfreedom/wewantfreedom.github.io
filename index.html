        <p>JPMorgan Chase Bank is yanking away some consumer rights from credit card holders, but we can stop them.</p>
        <p>Do you have one of their credit cards, like Sapphire, Slate, or United MileagePlus? Did you get a letter or email from them about “Changes to your Account”? Then this is important.</p>

        <p>With their “forced arbitration” clause, they’re changing the agreement so that you can’t get class-action payouts or sue them in open court if they mistreat you as a customer. For details on why this is bad, see the coverage on <a href="https://boingboing.net/2019/05/31/prelude-to-a-crime.html">Boing Boing</a> and <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90357331/chase-adds-forced-arbitration-clause-to-slate-credit-cards">Fast Company</a>. </p>

        <p>They’ve made it purposely hard to opt out of this change, by requiring you to write a physical letter, sign it and mail it. If you’re happy to DIY, here’s a <a href="https://militarymoneymanual.com/form-letter-to-reject-chase-arbitration-clause/">form letter</a>.</p>
        <p>I’m lazy and hate snail mail. But I figured, it’s easier if I write a form letter, we all sign it, and then I ship them all in one go, so that's what I'm doing. I reckon $3 should probably cover the signature software, printing and mailing costs. Put your deets below, and then I'll email you a link to digitally add your signature to the letter.</p>

      <h1>FAQs</h1>
      <b>How does it work?</b>
      <p>Once you enter your email address and complete the payment, you’ll receive an email from the signature software, where you can fill in your name, account number and home address, and draw your signature (you must draw, so they can’t wiggle out of it by blaming digital signatures). 
      </p>
      <p>In a week, I’ll print all the submitted and signed forms, and mail them to Chase. I’ll send you an email confirmation when I finish this.
      </p>
      
      <b>Who are you?</b>
      <p>Just a customer with a free afternoon to send a message to Chase that this is not OK. I am not a lawyer, just following the instructions from the press articles. I’m not revealing my identity, in case Chase gets trigger happy with their lawyers.</p>
      
      <b>Is my data safe?</b>
      <p>
        Your credit card data goes straight to Paypal, a renowned and widely used payment system, not to me. Your account number and address are only stored in the signature software. I’ll probably delete all records after 6 months when we’re sure to no longer need them.
      </p>
      
      <b>I have another question</b>
      <p>Send it to wewantfreedom2019 AT gmail.com. I might not reply asap as I’m going to be travelling for a bit.</p>
